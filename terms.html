            <h2>4.1 Overview</h2>
            
            <p>FarmCash is a rewards-based mobile application that allows users to earn virtual currency by completing various offers and activities provided through our advertising network partners.

            <h2>4.2 How It Works</h2>
            
            <p>Our Services operate as follows:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Browse Offers:</strong> You can browse available offers within the App. Offers may include installing and engaging with mobile applications, completing surveys, and other activities.</li>

                <li><strong>Earn Virtual Currency:</strong> Upon verified completion of an offer, you will receive virtual currency (Seeds) credited to your Account.</li>
                <li><strong>Convert and Withdraw:</strong> Accumulated Seeds mature into Cash, which can be withdrawn as real-world rewards through available withdrawal methods, subject to verification and minimum threshold requirements.</li>
            </ol>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Seeds:</strong> The primary virtual currency earned by completing offers. Seeds have no cash or monetary value.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash:</strong> A redeemable balance derived from matured Seeds that may be withdrawn subject to these Terms. Cash has no cash or monetary value until successfully withdrawn.</li>

            <h2>5.2 No Monetary Value</h2>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Virtual currency (including Seeds and Cash) has no cash, monetary, or other value and is not redeemable for cash except through the specific withdrawal methods we make available. Virtual currency is not your property; it represents a limited license to use a feature of our Services.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Virtual currency:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Has no equivalent value in real currency and does not constitute currency or property of any type;</li>

                <li>Cannot be refunded or exchanged for cash, except through approved withdrawal methods;</li>
                <li>May be forfeited upon account termination or violation of these Terms.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>5.3 Earning Virtual Currency</h2>
            
            <p>The amount of virtual currency awarded for completing offers varies based on multiple factors, including the type of offer, advertiser requirements, user engagement, and other criteria determined by us and our advertising partners. Different users may receive different amounts for similar or identical activities.</p>
            
            <p>We reserve the right to:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Change the amount of virtual currency awarded for any offer at any time;</li>
                <li>Limit the number of offers available to you;</li>
                <li>Limit the amount of virtual currency you can earn within any time period;</li>
                <li>Correct errors in virtual currency crediting, including removing incorrectly credited currency;</li>
                <li>Modify conversion rates between different types of virtual currency.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>5.4 Virtual Currency Expiration</h2>
            
            <p>Virtual currency in your Account may expire if your Account becomes inactive. Specifically:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Seeds and Cash will expire after one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days of Account inactivity.</strong></li>
                <li>Inactivity means no new virtual currency earned and no login to your Account.</li>
                <li>We may provide notice before expiration, but are not obligated to do so.</li>
                <li>Expired virtual currency cannot be restored.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>5.5 Crediting Delays</h2>
            
            <p>Virtual currency may not be credited immediately upon offer completion. Delays may occur due to:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Verification processes by our advertising partners;</li>
                <li>Fraud prevention reviews;</li>
                <li>Technical processing requirements;</li>
                <li>Advertiser-imposed waiting periods;</li>

            </ul>
            
            <p>We are not responsible for delays caused by third-party partners or factors outside our reasonable control. Pending virtual currency may remain in a "pending" status for up to thirty (30) days or longer, depending on the offer requirements.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Disabling tracking, using ad blockers, or interfering with attribution may prevent verification of your completions;</li>

            <h2>15.1 Applicability</h2>
            
            <p>This Section 15 applies to you if you are a resident of the United States or if you accessed or used our Services while located in the United States.</p>
            
            <h2>15.2 Agreement to Arbitrate</h2>
            
            <p>You and Mega Unlimited LTD agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or your use of our Services (collectively, <strong>"Disputes"</strong>) will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>You may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify;</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h2>15.3 No Class Actions</h2>
            
            <p><strong>YOU AND MEGA UNLIMITED LTD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong></p>
            
            <p>The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
            
            <h2>15.4 Arbitration Procedures</h2>
            
            <p>Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>"AAA"</strong>) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect, as modified by this Section. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p>
            
            <p>A single arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            
            <h2>15.5 Arbitration Location</h2>
            
            <p>Unless you and we agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in New York, New York, or, at your election, may be conducted by telephone or video conference.</p>
            
            <h2>15.6 Arbitration Costs</h2>
            
            <p>Payment of filing fees, administration fees, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. If you demonstrate that such costs would be prohibitive compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.</p>
            
            <h2>15.7 Opt-Out Right</h2>
            
            <p>You may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms by sending written notice to:</p>
